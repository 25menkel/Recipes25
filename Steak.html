        <h1>Steak</h1>
        <p>A red meat with a rich, savory flavor and varying degrees of tenderness depending on the cut  </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
                <li> Your choice cut of steak </li>
                <li> butter </li>
                <li> garlic </li>
                <li> fresh thyme </li>
                
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
                <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
                <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper – this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</li>
                <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in – again, for the crust</li>
                <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature (see chart below) because the internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and </li>
                <li>REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
                
        </ol>
